🛡️ Network Security: Phishing Detection 🛡️

🚀 Project Overview
In today’s digital world, phishing attacks have become one of the most significant threats to cybersecurity. These attacks deceive users into providing sensitive data like usernames, passwords, and credit card details by pretending to be trustworthy sources.

The Phishing Detection project aims to tackle this problem by using machine learning to analyze network traffic data and detect phishing attempts in real-time. With this solution, organizations can improve their security posture and protect their users from these malicious attacks.

🎯 Problem Statement
Phishing attacks are becoming more sophisticated and often bypass traditional security systems. This project addresses the need for a machine learning-based solution that can detect phishing activities and alert users before damage is done.

💡 Solution
This project leverages network traffic data to train a machine learning model that can recognize suspicious behavior indicative of phishing attempts. By deploying this model in a real-time monitoring system, the project detects and alerts users about potential phishing threats, enhancing network security.

🛠️ Features
Data Collection: Collects network traffic data to analyze potential phishing activities.
Machine Learning Model: Uses machine learning algorithms to detect phishing attempts based on historical data.
Real-Time Detection: Continuously monitors network traffic and raises alerts when phishing attempts are detected.
Alert System: Sends real-time alerts for detected phishing activities.
Schema Definition: Organizes the collected data into a structured format to improve model accuracy.
🏗️ Architecture
The architecture of this project is composed of the following components:

Data Collection Layer: Gathers network traffic data from different sources.
Data Preprocessing & Schema Layer: Organizes and prepares data for model training.
Model Training: Uses machine learning algorithms to train the phishing detection model.
Real-Time Detection: Deploys the trained model to detect phishing attacks in real-time within an application.
Alerting System: Notifies users when a potential phishing attempt is detected.

🧰 Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Machine Learning Frameworks: Scikit-learn
Database: MongoDB 
Web Framework: Fast API

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before running this project, make sure you have:

Python 3.10 installed
MongoDB (if using MongoDB)
Other dependencies mentioned in the requirements.txt file
Installation
Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/ishanpandey15/Networksecurity.git
cd Networksecurity
Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up MongoDB 

Run the application

python app.py
Usage
Once the application is up and running, it will automatically start monitoring network traffic and will alert you in case of any phishing attempts.

To test the system, you can use the provided test data or simulate network traffic to see how it reacts to phishing attempts.

🧪 Testing

To run tests for this project:
pytest
Make sure that all tests pass to validate the functionality of the application.

📊 Results
The machine learning model achieves an accuracy of X% in detecting phishing attacks, with 96.34% precision and 98.72% recall. You can further enhance the model by tuning the hyperparameters or adding more features.

🗺️ Roadmap
 Improve model accuracy by adding more features.
 Enhance the alert system to notify via email or SMS.
 Add a user authentication layer to the monitoring dashboard.
 Expand the dataset for better generalization.
